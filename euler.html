  <h1>Project Euler Excersizes</h1>

  <h2>Project Euler, assignment 1</h2>
  <p>the sum of all numbers below 1000, being multiples of 5 or 3,
    is <b><span id="euler1"></span></b></p>

  <h2>Project Euler, assignment 2</h2>
  <p>
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
     two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:<br><br>

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...<br><br>

    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
     exceed four million, the sum of the even-valued
      terms is <b><span id='euler2'></span></b>.

  </p>
  <h2>Project Euler, assignment 3</h2>
  <p>
    The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

    The largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 is <b><span id='euler3'></span></b>
