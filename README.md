# js_project_euler
This is my solution for The Odin Projects / Euler Project in JS (http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-basics)

## Things to note
* When a HTML object is not in the DOM yet, Javascript manipulating it will fail!
* HTML / CSS is kept simple for this is a pure JS assignment (No CSS at all :-))
